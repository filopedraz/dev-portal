# Interfaces

In order to simplify service packaging and have a commong denominator across all the services we expose, at Prem we defined the concept of `Interface`. An interface is a standard format for the service APIs endpoint. In this way, we can easily integrate new services and have a common way to interact with them.

Currently we suppor the following interfaces:

- Chat
- Embeddings
- Vector Store
- Diffuser
- Coder
- Text to Audio
- Audio to Text

To learn more about each interface, please refer to the dedicated section in the sidebar.
