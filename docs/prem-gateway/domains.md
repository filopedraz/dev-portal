At start, the Prem App is accessible via IP that is printed by the installation script. This IP is Prem Gateway IP address.

## How it works?

Domains feature gives you option to easily map your domain to your Prem App application.
It is necessary to insert two A records:

- A `example.com` to `<IP_GATEWAY>`
- A `*.example.com` `<IP_GATEWAY>`

You can also use a subdomain ie. `prem.example.com` and `*.prem.example.com`

After this is done you need to add your domain in **Prem App > Settings > Domains**, and you are ready to go.

- Enter Domain
  
![Add Domain](./add_domain.png)

- Provide the Domain and Submit

![Add Manual Domain](./add_manual_domain.png)

ðŸš€ You can now access Prem App from the domain provided (e.g., https://demo.prem.ninja)
